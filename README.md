# full body 3D scanners for 3D figurines, 3D portraits and 3D selfies
This project is to convert PortraitFCN+ from Matlab to Tensorflow (or something else FOSS), then feed the outputs from it (converted to a trimap) into the Deep Image Matting paper's code, supervised by Richard Berwick.

Second stage is to explore creating a phone-to-model pipeline to match a parameterized body model to iPhone photo (front, side) silhouettes and height/gender inputs so we have a relatively accurate body to use for fitting.
